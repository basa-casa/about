I mean it. I want you to move in here, with me. Whether you design learning, develop e-learning, teach, and especially if you learn. I'm building this place for everyone to get better at any and every complex thing we do. Before you move in though, let me describe the future of learning I want to see.

I believe there is no better way to learn than courses designed with 4 components and ten steps, and I've been sitting on this idea for too long.

In the now 4th edition of Ten Steps to Complex Learning, the authors lament the absence of design software for the model and for Instructional Design as a field. I also bear the weight of knowing I disappointed the authors a few years ago when I asked them to be advisers on the creation of this product, they agreed, and then I lost the competition and allowed the work to languish. This is the attempt at filling this need, that I believe has a great opportunity to succeed, because it is free to use.

I envision every person having their own "casa" - a repository of the whole tasks each of us perform, in our different functions. My Casa will have projects from work like learn modules and documentation set migrations, and things from life like baseball plays, adventures, and writings in it. Yours will have the things you do in yours.

I envision every organization having several "casas" - organized in as many ways as they need. Each casa might house one type of task, or one casa for the whole organization will house all tasks of all types. 

Most importantly, I see a future where people get better and adapt to all of the new things we will need to learn to do, faster, with a higher probability of success after training.

If you're involved in learning and instruction, please download the template and get started today. Don't worry, we're not reserving the moving trucks for you just yet. We want you to take a tour first and find out what living here is going to be like.
