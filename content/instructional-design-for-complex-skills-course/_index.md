## Learning Tasks

Learning tasks are the core activities that learners engage in to acquire new skills and knowledge. These tasks should be representative of real-world challenges and progressively increase in complexity. By working through these tasks, learners develop the ability to apply their knowledge in practical situations.

## Task Classes

Task classes group similar learning tasks together based on their complexity and the skills required to complete them. This classification helps in organizing the learning process, ensuring that learners build foundational skills before moving on to more advanced tasks.

## Assessment Instruments

Assessment instruments are tools used to evaluate the learners' performance and understanding. These can include quizzes, practical exams, and project-based assessments. Effective assessment instruments provide feedback that guides learners in their development and helps instructors identify areas needing improvement.

## Supportive Information

Supportive information includes all the background knowledge and conceptual understanding necessary for learners to perform learning tasks. This information is typically provided through lectures, readings, and multimedia resources, and it helps learners understand the why and how behind the tasks they are performing.

## Procedural Information

Procedural information consists of step-by-step instructions and guidelines that learners need to follow to complete specific tasks. This information is often provided in the form of manuals, checklists, and demonstrations, ensuring that learners can perform tasks accurately and efficiently.

## Part-task Practice

Part-task practice involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components and practicing each part separately. This approach allows learners to master individual skills before integrating them into more comprehensive tasks, leading to better overall performance.

## Systems of Assessment

Systems of assessment refer to the structured methods and processes used to evaluate and measure learners' progress and performance. These systems ensure that assessments are fair, consistent, and aligned with the learning objectives, providing a clear picture of learners' achievements and areas for improvement.
