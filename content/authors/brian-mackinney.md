Hi! I'm an Instructional Designer who recognizes the power of Four-Component Instructional Designs for learning effectiveness, and the powers of GitHub, Hugo, and CMSes for content managment. This is my attempt to combine it all into a school with the best courses possible. I need your help. Will you join me?
